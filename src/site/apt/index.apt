ploinFaces

  With ploinFaces you can define a flow for a JavaServerFaces-Webapplication. A flow contains views and attributes.
  If you leave the flow, the attributes will be removed from the http-session. It works with the 
  standard http-session scope. You need no special conversation scope. 
  There are no UI-Components in this library! PloinFaces contains little helpers for the developing of JSF-Applications 
  and makes periodic works much easier.
